# MSc Coursework in Urban Analytics and Visualisation

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of my MSc Coursework in Urban Analytics and Visualisation at the University of Warwick.

## Projects

The repository is divided into :

1. **Visualisation Project in R**: This project focuses on creating compelling visualisations using R. It includes various scripts and datasets used for the visualisations.

   ### Visualisation of 2020 Australian Bushfires Impact
   - Utilised Fire Hotspot data released by NASA to visualise the impact of the devastating 2020 bushfires in Australia.
   - Chronicled the fires that persisted for over 240 days, causing significant loss of life, destruction of homes, and environmental damage.
   - Visualised the spatial distribution of bushfire hotspots state-wise and analysed the data to provide insights into the severity of the crisis.
   - Identified hotspots of high activity and assessed the geographic patterns of the bushfires.
   - Employed visualisations to help stakeholders gain a deeper understanding of the bushfire crisis.
   - Utilised tools such as R/R-Studio with libraries including ggplot2, maps, mapdata and oz for this project.

2. **Data Analysis in QGIS, R, and GeoDa**: This project involves comprehensive data analysis using QGIS, R, and GeoDa. It includes scripts for data cleaning, analysis, and visualisation, as well as the datasets used.

   ### Inequality and Public Transport: The Case of East London
   - This group project aimed to assess the impact of improved public transport accessibility on inequality in East London.
   - Analysed public transport accessibility data (PTAL) in combination with socioeconomic indicators from the Indices of Multiple Deprivation.
   - The GIS analysis was performed in QGIS and GeoDa, whereas the statistical analysis was achieved in R.
   - The project discovered that public transport accessibility was positively associated with healthcare usage and had a connection with housing barriers.
   - The team observed a racial disparity in accessibility, with boroughs with predominantly white populations having better access.
   - The research suggests that further investigation is required using methods such as passenger surveys to understand who uses public transport and how it affects social equity.
